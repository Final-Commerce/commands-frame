  await commands.setRefundLineItemQuantity({
    itemKey: 'variant-id-123',
    quantity: 2
  });

  // Calculate the refund total
  const result = await commands.calculateRefundTotal();
  console.log('Refund total:', result);
  // Expected output:
  // {
  //   success: true,
  //   summary: {
  //     subtotal: '20.00',
  //     tax: '2.60',
  //     total: '22.60'
  //   },
  //   refundedLineItems: [...],
  //   refundedCustomSales: [...],
  //   timestamp: '2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z'
  // }

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to calculate refund total:', error);
}
```

## Error Handling

- Throws an error if no order is currently active.
- Throws an error if no refund details exist (no items selected for refund).

```typescript
// Example of error when no refund details
try {
  await commands.calculateRefundTotal();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // "No refund details. Please select items to refund first."
}
```

## Notes

- This is a preview calculation and does not process the refund.
- Calculations include taxes, discounts, fees, and tips proportionally.
- Tax calculations respect tax-inclusive vs tax-exclusive settings.
