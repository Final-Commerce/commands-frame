  // }

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to get remaining quantities:', error);
}
```

## Error Handling

- Throws an error if no order is currently active.

```typescript
// Example of error when no active order
try {
  await commands.getRemainingRefundableQuantities();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.message); // "No active order. Please set an order as active first."
}
```

## Notes

- Quantities are calculated based on original order quantities minus any previously refunded quantities.
- A quantity of 0 means the item has been fully refunded and cannot be refunded again.
